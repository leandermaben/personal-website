## Selected Publications and Projects

### TheAgentCompany: Benchmarking LLM Agents on Consequential Real World Tasks  
*Prof. Graham Neubig | NeurIPS 2025*  
- 580+ GitHub stars and 100+ paper citations  
- Benchmarked LLM agents on real-world tasks using production-like services (chat apps, cloud storage, GitLab, SDLC tools, LLM-powered coworkers).  
- Deployed each task in Dockerized environments for full reproducibility.  
- Demonstrated that even state-of-the-art agents solve only ~33% of real-world tasks.

### AURA: Voice Agent for Understanding, Reasoning, and Automated Tool Use  
*Prof. Shinji Watanabe | ASRU 2025*  
- Built the first open-source, speech-native conversational assistant supporting full speech-to-speech, multi-turn dialogue with dynamic tool use.  
- Supported tasks including calendar booking, web search, and email.  
- Achieved **92.75%** on VoiceBench-OpenBookQA, surpassing all open-weight systems and nearing GPT-4o (92.97%).  
- Human evaluation showed **90% task success** on multi-turn, multi-goal speech tasks.
- Shortlisted for top-3 best demo papers.

### Device and Method for Detecting Cervical Cancer Abnormality  
*Patented — Indian Patent Office*  
*Deployed for field testing at Kasturba Hospital, Manipal*  
- Achieved **92.31% accuracy** and **98.24% sensitivity**.  
- Built an on-device lightweight CNN using a modified MobileNetV2 architecture.  
- Provided interpretability via Grad-CAM visualizations.

### OpenHands — LLM-Based Code Editor  
*Prof. Graham Neubig | 64k GitHub stars*  
- Improved resolve rate by up to **8.3%** on SWE-Bench Lite subsets.  
- Developed an efficient LLM-based code editing tool for the CodeAct agent.  
- Fine-tuned code editing LLMs via distributed multi-GPU training and multi-step synthetic data generation.

### Additional Publications
- Study of Generative Adversarial Networks for Noisy Speech Simulation from Clean Speech — *APSIPA 2023*  
- Protecting Your Online Persona: A Preferential Selective Encryption Approach — *IEEE Access*  
- Dynamic Twitter Friend Grouping Based on Similarity, Interaction, and Trust — *IET Communications*
